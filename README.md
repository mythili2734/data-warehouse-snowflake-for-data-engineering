### Real-Time Data Streaming using Apache NiFi, AWS, Snowpipe, and Snowflake Streams and Tasks

This project demonstrates to build a robust and scalable data pipeline that can generate, store, process, and analyze data streams in real-time. By leveraging the capabilities of AWS, Snowflake, and Apache NiFi, this pipeline aims to automate data flows, ensure data integrity, and provide immediate analytical insights.


### Architecture:


![Architecture for snowflake](https://github.com/mythili2734/data-warehouse-snowflake-for-data-engineering/assets/158598007/f5cead9c-7681-4803-8c63-37eeae93c0fe)

### Technologies Used:

1. *AWS:*  Amazon Web Services provides cloud computing services for storing data and running applications.
2. *Snowflake:*  A cloud-based data warehousing platform for data storage and analysis.
3. *Apache NiFi:* An open-source data integration platform that facilitates the automation of data flow between systems.
4. *Docker:* Used for containerization of applications and services for easy deployment.
5. *Python Faker Library:* Generates fake data for testing and development purposes.


#### Components:

1. *Apache NiFi:*
   - *Data Ingestion:* Use NiFi to collect data from various sources (e.g., APIs, IoT devices, databases).
   - *Data Transformation:* Transform and format the data as required before sending it to AWS.

2. *AWS Services:*
   - *S3:* Store the data files.
   - *SNS/SQS:* Facilitate messaging and notification for data processing workflows.
   - *Lambda:* Process and move data between services if necessary.

3. *Snowflake:*
   - *Snowpipe:* Automatically ingest data from S3 into Snowflake.
   - *Streams:* Track changes in tables (e.g., new data ingested by Snowpipe).
   - *Tasks:* Automate and schedule SQL operations based on the data ingested.

#### Pipeline Overview

1. *Data Generation:*
   - Use the Python Faker library to generate fake data for testing and development purposes.

2. *Data Storage:*
   - Store the generated data in AWS S3.

3. *Data Processing:*
   - Use Snowpipe, Stream, Task to automatically ingest the data from S3 into Snowflake .

4. *Data Analysis:*
   - Analyze the ingested data in Snowflake to gain real-time insights.
  


#### Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of real-time data analysis using AWS, Snowflake, and NiFi. By integrating these technologies, organizations can efficiently manage and analyze large volumes of data, enabling informed decision-making and insights generation. The automation capabilities provided by Snowflake tasks and NiFi streamline the data processing pipeline, enhancing efficiency and scalability.
