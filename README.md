### Real-Time Data Streaming using Apache NiFi, AWS, Snowpipe, and Snowflake Streams and Tasks

This project demonstrates to build a robust and scalable data pipeline that can generate, store, process, and analyze data streams in real-time. By leveraging the capabilities of AWS, Snowflake, and Apache NiFi, this pipeline aims to automate data flows, ensure data integrity, and provide immediate analytical insights.


*Architecture:*


![Architecture for snowflake](https://github.com/mythili2734/data-warehouse-snowflake-for-data-engineering/assets/158598007/f5cead9c-7681-4803-8c63-37eeae93c0fe)


*Objective:*
Implement a real-time data streaming pipeline that ingests data using Apache NiFi, processes it through AWS services, and loads it into Snowflake for further processing using Snowpipe, Streams, and Tasks.

#### Components:

1. *Apache NiFi:*
   - *Data Ingestion:* Use NiFi to collect data from various sources (e.g., APIs, IoT devices, databases).
   - *Data Transformation:* Transform and format the data as required before sending it to AWS.

2. *AWS Services:*
   - *S3:* Store the data files.
   - *SNS/SQS:* Facilitate messaging and notification for data processing workflows.
   - *Lambda:* Process and move data between services if necessary.

3. *Snowflake:*
   - *Snowpipe:* Automatically ingest data from S3 into Snowflake.
   - *Streams:* Track changes in tables (e.g., new data ingested by Snowpipe).
   - *Tasks:* Automate and schedule SQL operations based on the data ingested.

#### Detailed Workflow:

1. *Data Ingestion with Apache NiFi:*
   - *Source Integration:* Configure NiFi processors to fetch data from various sources.
   - *Data Transformation:* Use NiFi's transformation capabilities to format and clean the data.
   - *Data Flow:* Direct the transformed data into an AWS S3 bucket.

2. *AWS S3:*
   - *Storage:* Store the incoming data files from NiFi.
   - *Event Notifications:* Set up S3 event notifications to trigger further processing, such as invoking AWS Lambda or notifying via SNS/SQS.

3. *AWS Lambda (optional):*
   - *Data Processing:* Perform additional processing or validation if needed.
   - *S3 to Snowflake:* If more complex processing is required before loading into Snowflake, use Lambda functions.

4. *Snowflake Integration:*
   - *Snowpipe:*
     - *Automatic Ingestion:* Configure Snowpipe to listen for new files in the S3 bucket and load them into Snowflake tables.
   - *Streams:*
     - *Change Data Capture:* Create streams to track changes in the Snowflake tables, enabling real-time data processing.
   - *Tasks:*
     - *Automation:* Schedule tasks to process new data ingested by Snowpipe and tracked by streams. Tasks can run SQL scripts to perform aggregations, updates, and other operations on the data.


#### Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of real-time data analysis using AWS, Snowflake, and NiFi. By integrating these technologies, organizations can efficiently manage and analyze large volumes of data, enabling informed decision-making and insights generation. The automation capabilities provided by Snowflake tasks and NiFi streamline the data processing pipeline, enhancing efficiency and scalability.
